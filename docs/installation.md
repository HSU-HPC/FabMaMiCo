# Installation

As FabMaMiCo is a plugin for FabSim3, you need to install FabSim3 first.  
Once installed, you can install FabMaMiCo as a plugin for FabSim3.

## FabSim3

!!! note
	Changes to the FabSim3 repository have not been merged into the official repository yet, so please follow the instructions below to install FabSim3.

    Otherwise:
    (For the installation of FabSim3, please refer to the [FabSim3 documentation](https://fabsim3.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation/).)

1. Clone the FabSim3 repository:

    ```sh
	git clone https://github.com/jomichaelis/FabSim3.git
	```

2. To install all pip-packages automatically and to configure yml files, please type:
	```sh
	cd FabSim3
	python3 configure_fabsim.py
	```

3. After installation process, the root FabSim3 directory should be added to both `PATH` and `PYTHONPATH` environment variables. The instruction to do that will be shown at the end of output of `python3 configure_fabsim.py` command.
	```bash
	Congratulation üçª
	FabSim3 installation was successful ‚úî
	
	In order to use fabsim command anywhere in your PC, you need to update the PATH
	and PYTHONPATH environmental variables.
	
		export PATH=<install-path>/FabSim3/fabsim/bin:$PATH
		export PYTHONPATH=<install-path>/FabSim3:$PYTHONPATH

		export PATH=~/.local/bin:$PATH
	
	The last list is added because the required packages are installed with flag 
	"--user" which makes pip install packages in your your home instead instead 
	of system directory.


	Tip: To make these updates permanent, you can add the following command at the 
	end of your bash shell script which could be one of ['~/.bashrc', '~/.bash_profile', 
	'~/.zshrc', '~/.bash_aliases'] files, depends on your OS System.

	üõé To load the new updates in PATH and PYTHONPATH you need to reload your bash shell 
	script, e.g., source ~/.bashrc, or lunch a new terminal.
	```

4. To make the fabsim command available in your system, please restart the shell by opening a new terminal or just re-load your bash profile by `source` command.
