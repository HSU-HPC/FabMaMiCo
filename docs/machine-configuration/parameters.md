## Machine-specific parameters

Here, the default-configuration is given.
If variables are in brackets `<var>`, they are placeholders and need to be replaced with the actual values.

FabSim3 reads these parameters prior of executing a task.
It provides all parameters by concept of a global variable (`env`), that can be accessed and queried during task execution.
Users can thus access all parameters in their scripts.

#### Connection
```yaml
remote: "<host-url>"
# The URL of the remote machine's login node.
```

```yaml
manual_ssh: false
# Flag to bypass paramiko and to execute direct remote SSH commands.
```

```yaml
manual_gsissh: false
# Flag to use GSISSH instead of SSH.
```

```yaml
manual_sshpass: false
# Flag to use sshpass within SSH (requires that either value for sshpass is set with filename of plaintext password file for this machine or SSHPASS set in environment)
```

```yaml
ssh_monsoon_mode: false
# Flag to use 'monsoon mode', which avoids rsync and instead uses scp.
```

#### Filesystem
```yaml
home_path_template: "/home/$username"
# The template for the home directory of the user on the remote machine.
# `$username` will be replaced by the value of the parameter `username`.
```

```yaml
fabric_dir: "FabSim"
# Name for the remote FabSim3 folder holding config_files, results and scripts.
```

```yaml
remote_path_template: "$home_path/$fabric_dir"
# Path to the FabSim3 folder on the remote machine.
```

# These templates are located in the templates/ subdirectory.
```

```yaml
job_dispatch: ''

# e.g. qsub, empty string to launch interactively
#   (e.g. on localhost, a VM or a machine without scheduler).
```

```yaml
stat: "qstat -u $username"
# Default command syntax for getting the job status.
```

```yaml

# Default naming scheme used to label FabSim3 jobs.
```

#### Environment
```yaml
venv : False
# Loading virtual environment on the remote machine.
```


#### Other
```yaml
prevent_results_overwrite: "ignore"
# possible inputs are: ["delete","ignore","warn_only"]
