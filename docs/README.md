# docs

This folder contains the documentation for the FabMaMiCo plugin.
It is created using the [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) tool.

To run the documentation locally, execute the following command in the `docs` directory:

```bash
mkdocs serve
```

## Continuous Deployment
The documentation is automatically deployed to the [FabMaMiCo documentation page](https://hsu-hpc.github.io/FabMaMiCo/) using GitHub Actions, whenever the master branch changes.
